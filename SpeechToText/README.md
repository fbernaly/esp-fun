# SPEECH TO TEXT

This project demonstrates how to use the INMP441 microphone with an ESP32 microcontroller for speech-to-text functionality using [Google's Speech-to-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) within the Arduino IDE. Pressing the pushbutton triggers the ESP32 to record audio for a predetermined duration. An LED visually indicates the recording process. The recorded audio is encoded using 16-bit linear pulse-code modulation (PCM) and securely transmitted to Google's server via a web socket established through [WiFiClientSecure](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/WiFiClientSecure). The resulting speech-to-text transcription is then displayed in the Serial Monitor.

## Google's Speech-to-Text API Key

Before jumping into coding get an API Key in order to use [Google's Speech-to-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text). To setup up an API Key follow [these steps](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862). Replace your API Key in the Sketch:

Before diving into coding, you'll need an API key from [Google's Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) service. Here's how to obtain and set it up:

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Enable the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for your project.
4. Go to the "APIs & Services" section and click on "Credentials".
5. Click on "Create credentials" and select "API key".
6. Copy the generated API key and paste it into the designated field replacing the placeholder.

```c++
const char* googleApiKey = "<YOUR_API_KEY>";
```

Remember to keep your API key secure and avoid sharing it publicly. To read more about [Setting up API keys](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862) go [here](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862).

This project leverages the [speech:recognize API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/reference/rest/v1/speech/recognize) as detailed in [Transcribe short audio files](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/sync-recognize). This enables the ESP32 to process user speech in real-time for interactive voice commands.

Following the recommendations outlined in [Best practices to provide data to the Speech-to-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/best-practices-provide-speech-data), the audio in this project is sampled at `16,000 Hz` and encoded using 16-bit linear pulse-code modulation (PCM) in the `LINEAR16` format.

For detailed information on audio encoding for Speech-to-Text, refer to these resources: 

* [Introduction to audio encoding for Speech-to-Text ](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/encoding)
* [WAVE PCM soundfile format](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/)

## Recording duration

The ESP32 will record audio for a predetermined duration, which is pass when calling the `Transcribe()` method.

Pass the duration 

```c++
MicController* controller = new MicController(...);

int duration = 5;  // Duration in seconds
String stt = controller->Transcribe(duration);
```

I have included this [spreadsheet](./audio_constants_stt.xlsx) to assists with computing the constants.

## Wiring up

Modify the wiring as needed.
