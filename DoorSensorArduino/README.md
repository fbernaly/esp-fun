# DoorSensor with Arduino and serial wireless communication.

In this project a magnetic switch turn on/off the power for the Arduino and the Arduino starts. After n `notifyAfter` seconds the Arduino sends a cmd using a wireless serial interface like bluetooth, TTL-WiFi, etc. A push button can be attached to `buttonPin` to turn on/off the count down process. A led in `LEDPin` indicates if the countdown process is running or not. An ESP32 should run a server to receive the cmd that the wireless interface is sending (see [related project](../ESPHomeServer/ESPHomeServer.ino)). ESP32 receives the cmd and plays a massage in a Google device in your home.
