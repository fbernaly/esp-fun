# Door Sensor with ESP32

In this project a magnetic switch turn on/off the power for the ESP32 and the ESP32 starts. After n `notifyAfter` seconds the ESP32 asks a Google device in your house to play a message. A push button can be attached to `buttonPin` to turn on/off the count down process. A led in `LEDPin` indicates if the countdown process is running or not.
